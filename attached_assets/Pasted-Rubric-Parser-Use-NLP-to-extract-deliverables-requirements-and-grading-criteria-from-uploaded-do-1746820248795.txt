Rubric Parser - Use NLP to extract deliverables, requirements, and grading criteria from uploaded documents
Smart Task Breakdown - Automatically segment large deliverables into smaller, actionable tasks
Dynamic Timeline Generator - Create a visual timeline that adapts based on the due date and task dependencies
Priority Algorithm - Calculate which tasks are most critical based on point value, complexity, and time constraints

Enhanced Features:

Personalized Work Patterns - Learn from user behavior to suggest optimal work schedules based on their actual productivity patterns
Difficulty Estimator - Assess the complexity of each task and estimate time requirements
Focus Mode Timer - Built-in Pomodoro timer customized to task complexity
Progress Visualization - Interactive charts showing completion rates and remaining work
Notification System - Smart reminders that escalate in urgency as deadlines approach
Companion Mobile App - Sync with the web version for on-the-go updates

Technical Challenges to Showcase:

Machine learning for pattern recognition in user work habits
Natural language processing for rubric analysis
Data visualization for progress tracking
Real-time updates and notifications

Would you like me to expand on any of these features or suggest a technical stack that could support this project?RetryJCan you focus on the JavaScriptEditFocusing on the JavaScript aspects of your Deadline Dash project, here are some feature ideas that would showcase your JavaScript skills and add complexity:
Core JavaScript Features:

Dynamic Rubric Analysis - Use JavaScript to parse uploaded text/documents and extract key deliverables using regex patterns or natural language processing libraries
Interactive Task Breakdown - Create a dynamic UI that allows users to drag-and-drop tasks to reorganize their workflow
Real-time Timeline Generator - Use JavaScript Date objects to calculate optimal task distribution and render a responsive timeline
Local Storage Integration - Save user progress and preferences even when offline

Enhanced JavaScript Functionality:

Custom Task Scheduler Algorithm - Write a JavaScript algorithm that optimizes task distribution based on priority, complexity, and available time
Client-side Document Parser - Implement FileReader API to analyze rubrics directly in the browser
Interactive Data Visualizations - Use D3.js or Chart.js to create animated progress charts and burndown graphs
Smart Notification System - Create custom notification timing logic that adjusts based on user behavior

JavaScript Libraries to Consider:

React or Vue.js for building a responsive component-based UI
TensorFlow.js for implementing simple machine learning to predict task completion times
Day.js or Moment.js for sophisticated date manipulation
PDF.js for parsing PDF rubrics
IndexedDB for robust client-side storage of complex project data

JavaScript Technical Challenges:

Implement custom event listeners for real-time updates across components
Create a state management system for tracking project progress
Build service workers for offline functionality
Develop custom hooks or composables for reusable project tracking logic
